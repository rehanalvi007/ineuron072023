    "<h3>Q1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?</h3>\n",
    "<p><strong>Ans - </strong>The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system. It emphasizes organizing data and functionality into reusable, self-contained units called objects. These objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods or functions) that relate to the entities they represent.</p>"

    "<h3>Q2. What is an object in Python?</h3>\n",
    "<p><strong>Ans - </strong> An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.<br>An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data.</p>"

    "<p><strong>Ans -</strong> A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object. </p>"

    "Attributes are the data members of a class that represent the characteristics or state of the objects created from that class. They are essentially variables associated with the class and its instances (objects). Attributes define what data an object can hold, and each object of the class can have its own unique values for these attributes.</p>\n",
    "<p><strong>Methods (Functions or Behaviors):</strong>\n",

    "<h3>Q5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?</h3>\n",
    "<p><strong>Ans-</strong>Class variables and instance variables are two types of variables used within a class, but they have distinct scopes and purposes:\n",
    "<ul><strong>Class Variables:</strong>\n",
    "<li>Class variables are variables that are defined at the class level and are shared among all instances (objects) of that class.</li>\n",
    "<li>They are declared inside the class, outside of any method, and are usually placed near the top of the class definition.</li>\n",
    "<li>Class variables are accessible through the class itself, and any modification to the class variable affects all instances of that class.</li></ul>\n",
    "<ul><strong>Instance Variables:</strong>\n",
    "<li>Instance variables are specific to each instance (object) of the class. They are defined inside the class methods, typically within the constructor (__init__ method).</li>\n",
    "<li>Each object of the class has its own copy of instance variables, which means changes to these variables are isolated to the specific instance they belong to.</li>\n",

    "<p><strong>Ans - </strong>Self is a parameter that refer to current instance of the class and is used to access variables that belong to the class.<br>The self parameter is automatically passed to the method when we call it on an instance of the class. This means that when we call an instance method, Python automatically passes the instance itself as the first argument, allowing us to work with the specific instance's data.</p>"
