    "<h3>Q1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used?</h3>\n",
    "<p><strong>Ans - </strong><code>Inheritance</code> in object-oriented programming allows a subclass to inherit properties and behaviors from a superclass. It promotes code reusability, abstraction, and flexibility. Subclasses can extend and override the functionality of the superclass, making the code organized and easier to maintain. It is a key concept that enables the creation of class hierarchies and supports the principle of polymorphism.<br>In Python, inheritance is used to create <code>class hierarchies</code> and promote <code>code reusability, abstraction, and polymorphism.</code> It allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass, avoiding code duplication and making the code more organized and maintainable."

    "<p><strong>Ans - </strong><code>Single Inheritance -</code> Single Inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single parent class.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>Multiple Inheritance - </code> Multi level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Differences:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol><li><strong>Number of Superclasses:</strong> The main difference between single and multiple inheritance is the number of superclasses a class can have. Single inheritance allows only one superclass, while multiple inheritance allows a class to have multiple superclasses.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><strong>Diamond Problem:</strong> One common issue with multiple inheritance is the Diamond Problem. It occurs when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common ancestor. In such cases, conflicts may arise if the subclass attempts to call a method or access an attribute that is defined in multiple superclasses.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Multiple inheritance can lead to more complex class hierarchies, which might be harder to understand and maintain compared to the simpler linear hierarchy of single inheritance.</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Single inheritance is straightforward and prevents the Diamond Problem, while multiple inheritance allows for code reusability, rich class hierarchies, and greater flexibility in class design.</li>\n",

    "<p><strong>Ans - </strong>The \"super\" keyword in inheritance is used to call a method or access an attribute from the superclass (base class) within a subclass (derived class). It allows the subclass to reuse and extend the functionality defined in the superclass. By using \"super,\" you can avoid duplicating code and maintain a clear hierarchy when overriding methods in the subclass.<br>\n",
